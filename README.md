# Kindergarten
## Introduction
Application and enrollment in municipal kindergartens in Sofia have been done electronically for some years now and has been a great improvement over the “paper” based system that was in place before.
One very important downside of the application system is that parents often get their kids enrolled in a kindergarten that is not the best choice for them (not the one that is most highly desired). Once their kid is enrolled (which itself is a great success) it becomes practically impossible for the same kid to change its kindergarten with another one (in theory it’s possible if the kid applies for a new kindergarten but in practice it’s highly improbable to be admitted because the kid get penalized for being already admitted once). The results is that many kids get “stuck” in kindergarten that is far from home or not the best option for various reasons.
One option to “change” a kindergarten is if parent A find parent B and their kids switch places. For this to happen kid A needs to take the place of kid B and kid B – the place of kid A.

This study project was inspired by the real need for a “place” on internet where parents of kids that are willing to switch can “find” themselves if their “desired” kindergartens match. In this way many kids can finally find their way to a more convenient kindergarten.
